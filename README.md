🚀 Python OOP Mini Project – Fund Transfer System

I recently built a Python-based Fund Transfer System to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

🔹 Key concepts used:
✔ Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
✔ Inheritance
✔ Encapsulation (private variables & properties)
✔ Class methods & class variables
✔ Real-world logic (NFT & RTGS transfers with charges)

🔹 Features:
• NFT & RTGS fund transfers
• Automatic charge calculation
• Balance validation
• Console-based user interaction

This project helped me understand how OOP concepts are applied in real-world systems like banking applications.
